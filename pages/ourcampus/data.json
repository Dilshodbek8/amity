      "small": "Our school was founded in September 2015 as a small primary school providing the National Curriculum of England and Wales for boys and girls. The school’s popularity amongst the Abu Dhabi community has grown rapidly. Six years later, the school has grown by over 600% and now caters for a diverse range of pupils aged 3 to 18 with an equally diverse range of interests, backgrounds, and aspirations. The school features state-of-the-art, unrivalled facilities that, together with an outstanding team of educators and support staff, help pupils to fulfil their academic aspirations, as well as develop into independent, confident, global citizens and life-long learners.  With a wide range of subjects and co-curricular activities, we ensure that every child’s needs, interests, and talents are catered for. We take great pride in the culturally diverse and caring environment that we provide for our pupils and the global outlook that we foster. "

        "The BSc (Hons) Finance is a rigorous academic course which will help you build a strong financial background and key professional skills, required in today’s workplace. You will develop a fundamental understanding of how organisations, including large national and international corporations, commercial banks, investment and risk management firms, make financial decisions and how these processes work. You will learn to think analytically and become able to critically evaluate key concepts in socio-economic, legal and other contexts within which finance operates .  During the course you will develop problem-solving and team-working skills and enhance a business understanding that is highly important in an intertwined global financial world. You will also acquire transferable and cognitive skills necessary for lifelong personal and professional development. These versatile skills will enable you, as a graduate of the course, to gain employment in the industry, to skillfully manage your own finances and to engage in further study in the field of finance or a related field.",
      title2: "How you will study",
      desc2:
        "The course emphasises on active student learning through seminars and lectures (including virtual), computer-lab and financial markets suite workshops, problem-based and blended learning activities. Course material is provided through an online learning platform and this is an important resource base which you can access at any time and from anywhere, provided you have access to the internet. You are encouraged, guided and supported towards developing your finance and other professional skills as an independent critically aware learner. Each module requires both specified lecture hours and independent learning. The hours may differ significantly depending on the specific subject matter, your level of study and the approach to teaching and learning. You are strongly encouraged to work in groups with other students during seminars and workshops and for non-assessed purposes, including revision and examination preparation. This provides you with the opportunity to learn from your fellow students, value the views of others and learn how to give and receive constructive feedback.",

        "The BSc (Hons) Finance is a rigorous academic course which will help you build a strong financial background and key professional skills, required in today’s workplace. You will develop a fundamental understanding of how organisations, including large national and international corporations, commercial banks, investment and risk management firms, make financial decisions and how these processes work. You will learn to think analytically and become able to critically evaluate key concepts in socio-economic, legal and other contexts within which finance operates .  During the course you will develop problem-solving and team-working skills and enhance a business understanding that is highly important in an intertwined global financial world. You will also acquire transferable and cognitive skills necessary for lifelong personal and professional development. These versatile skills will enable you, as a graduate of the course, to gain employment in the industry, to skillfully manage your own finances and to engage in further study in the field of finance or a related field.",
      title2: "How you will study",
      desc2:
        "The course emphasises on active student learning through seminars and lectures (including virtual), computer-lab and financial markets suite workshops, problem-based and blended learning activities. Course material is provided through an online learning platform and this is an important resource base which you can access at any time and from anywhere, provided you have access to the internet. You are encouraged, guided and supported towards developing your finance and other professional skills as an independent critically aware learner. Each module requires both specified lecture hours and independent learning. The hours may differ significantly depending on the specific subject matter, your level of study and the approach to teaching and learning. You are strongly encouraged to work in groups with other students during seminars and workshops and for non-assessed purposes, including revision and examination preparation. This provides you with the opportunity to learn from your fellow students, value the views of others and learn how to give and receive constructive feedback.",

        "The course consists of core and option modules. Full-time Undergraduate students study 120 credits per year. The course structure is validated by the University of Westminster (UK) every five years, but the structure of the course may change by adapting to feedback received from a variety of sources.",
